==================
# client 2.1
==================


Console based telnet client with full color support.

#TODO
- Use imgui or similar tech to create a custom tty, this should allow the same code to be cross platform.
- Add other supported event types for scripting current there is only alias (commands you type as input) or actions (respoding to text coming from the server)
- use sol2 instead of raw lua
